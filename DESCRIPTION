    c(person(given = "Johan",
             family = "Larsson",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: A wrapper around the C++ library 
    'polylabel' from 'Mapbox', providing an efficient routine for
    finding the approximate pole of inaccessibility of a polygon, which
    usually serves as an excellent candidate for labeling of a polygon.
